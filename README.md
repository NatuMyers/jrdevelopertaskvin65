files:

1. 2-column- layout.htm

2. screen.css

3. jquery.js

4. readme.docx (this file)

You’re tasked with editing the 2-column- layout.htm file so that it includes the following:

b. A navigation that’s aligned right

2. Content with:

4. Include jQuery, and when the page is ready, change the background color using

Feel free to style however you’d like beyond these guidelines, but we will be mainly focused on

the actual code written rather than the overall look.

Please send your zipped up files to karson@vin65.com. Once we review them, we’ll contact

you about whether we’d like to bring you in for a second interview.
